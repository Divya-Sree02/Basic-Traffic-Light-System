# Basic-Traffic-Light-System

# Overview
This Arduino-based project simulates a traffic light system that operates normally but immediately turns red when a pedestrian presses a button. The system then resumes its regular cycle after a short delay.

# Features
 -Normal Traffic Light Cycle – Green → Yellow → Red → Green.<br>
 -Pedestrian Crossing Mode – Button press turns red instantly.<br>
 -Resumes Normal Cycle After pedestrian crossing.<br>

# Components Required
-Arduino Uno <br>
-Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs <br>
-Push Button (for pedestrian crossing) <br>
-3 × 220Ω Resistors (for LEDs) <br>
-1kΩ Resistor (for button) <br>
-Breadboard & Jumper Wires.<br>
